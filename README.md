# Angular5AndWebAPi
using token (jwt) auth with angular 5 and web api 

-Included are both web api in .net and .net core
-angular is using interceptors to handle tokens


## open the api solution and restore the nuget packages
NOTE:  this solution uses [.net core 2.0](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/08/14/announcing-net-core-2-0/) and that must be installed.

-execute api or api.core

## in the web/loginapp  folder
-perform an 'npm install'
-the system uses angular cli so install that (probably globally) 
-run 'ng serve'
